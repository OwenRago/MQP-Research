Basic Ansible setup

The hosts file contains the addresses of the servers that are to be managed

1. To run this first you must install Ansible on your machine https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

2. Afterwards run this command "ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml"

3. From here you can go to http://localhost which you should see a hello world webpage

4. If you want to run this on a different machine instead, change the hosts file and set the address to what you need with this format: "{your_server_ip} ansible_user={your_username} ansible_password={your_password}"

The setup or playbook file is a set of instructions that are to be executed on a different host
They are made up of multiple tasks which run in sequence
