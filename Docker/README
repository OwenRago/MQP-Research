Basic Docker setup:

The dockerfile is a file that contains the instructions to build a docker image.
The docker image is a snapshot of the environment that the application needs to run.

The docker-compose file is a file that can be used to build and start the docker container

server.py is a simple echo server that runs within a container

client.py is a simple client to interact with the container

HOW TO USE:
First run "docker-compose up --build" this will build the docker container

Next run "python client.py" this will start the client which you can use to interact with the docker container

OTHER DOCKER STUFF:
A requirements.txt is typically used to install any libraries before anything else is run
You can run bash scripts from the dockerfile or docker-compose file before the container is fully operational
