Basic Jenkins Setup

1. Run "bash setup.sh" this will create the docker containers that are necessary to host Jenkins
2. From there go to http://localhost:8080 which will bring you to the Jenkins starting page
3. You can then create a pipeline of your choosing, I used this (https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/) tutorial

Jenkins is used for CI/CD (Continous Integration/Continous Deployment) delivery pipelines or in other words it allows developers to more easily deploy and manage code.
You create pipelines or jobs in Jenkins which can be run on schedule, demand or triggered automatically in order to do common tasks.
